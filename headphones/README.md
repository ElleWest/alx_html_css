# Headphones Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive landing page for a headphones company, built as part of the ALX Frontend program. The design is based on a Figma file and includes multiple sections, custom fonts, icons, and interactive features. The page adapts to both desktop and mobile screens, with a hamburger menu for mobile navigation.

## Features
- Pixel-perfect implementation based on Figma design
- Responsive layout: switches to mobile view at 480px or less
- Custom fonts: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT
- Custom icon font for the "What we do..." section
- Interactive header/hero section
- "What we do..." and "Our results" sections with reusable components
- Contact form with validation and optional animations
- Footer with social links
- All pentagons in "Our results" drawn with CSS (no images)
- Fun animations for section items
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation (JavaScript, no frameworks)
